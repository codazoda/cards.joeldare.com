    <p>A minimalist, long lasting, HTML template.<p>
    
    <p>Neat.html is a minimalist HTML template for writing.</p>

    <p>I like my web pages neat. Neat is a minimalist, long lasting, HTML and CSS template. Inspired by other minimalist sites like <a href="100r.co">Hundred Rabits</a>.</p>
 
    <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

    <p>Neat.html follows these rules.</p>

    <p>Small</p>

    <p>Neat was designed to be very small.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Simple HTML and CSS only</li>
        <li>Symantec</li>
        <li>Small</li>
        <li>Accessable</li>
        <li>Long lasting</li>
        <li>Free</li>
        <li>Responsive</li>
        <li>Low Energy and Fast</li>
        <li>Todo</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>Neat was designed to be small.</p>

    <h3>Low Energy and Fast</h3>

    <p>Designed to be fast, even on the slowest connections. Consuming very little memory, bandwidth, and energy on both the server and the client.</p>

    <h3>Long Lasting</h3>

    <p>Technology changes fast. The technology that's stuck around the longest is html.</p>


    <h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Copy neat.html to index.html and edit it in your favorite text editor.</p>

    <p>Make your own changes to the <em>custom.css</em> file. That way you can update <em>neat.css</em> and keep all your modifications intact.</p>


    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

    <p>Neat.html was designed for.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <li>Journals</li>
        <li>Technical sites</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Books</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Neat.html was designed for.</p>


    <h2 id="decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

    <p>As with anything, you've got to make decisions on the design of Neat.html. Here are some of the decisions I've made and the rational for them.</p>

    <h3>Max Width</h3>

    <p>The body max-width is 800px by default. I find a thinner column of text to be more readable on very large monitors. This is simple to change by editing the <em>max-width</em> of the <em>body</em> element in <em>neat.css</em>.</p>

    <h3>Left Aligned</h3>

    <p>The body is left aligned. I tried center aligned first, but I just wasn't feeling it. I visited some of my favorite sites on the web and found that most of them where left aligned. So, I went with that.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>

    <p>Images are 100% width by default.</p>

    <h3>Left Gutter</h3>

    <p>The left gutter is wider at larger sizes, giving the page a little more breathing room.</p> 

    <h3>Buttons are Links</h3>

    <p>One of the goals is to use symantic web tags. Buttons are a unique case because most people want a button to link somewhere, but the button tag doesn't currently support the href attribute. Buttons, in Neat are <em>anchor</em> tags with a <em>class</em> of <em>button</em>.</p>

    <code><a class="button" href="#">Button</a></code>


    <h2 id="github">Github</h2>

    <p>You'll find <a href="https://github.com/codazoda/neat.html">Neat.html on Github</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="todo">ToDo</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Make indexes have a special class</li>
        <li>Add buttons, kinda like skeleton</li>
    </ul>

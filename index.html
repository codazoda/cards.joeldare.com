    <p>Create handmade cards for the people that matter most to you.<p>

    <p>I started, accidentally, creating handmade cards a long time ago. I would procrastinate getting a card until it was too late. Then, in a panic, I would create a handmade card late the night before. It got the job done, but I often felt a little bad about it.</p>
        
    <p>Then, on one particular holiday, I finally made it to the store well before the day. I purchased a store baught card and had my kids each sign it. A few days later my wife opened the card and was disapointed. I had failed to realize how much she loved receiving those homemade cards I had been slapping together at the last minute.</p>
    
    <p>I've been created these cards for my wife for nearly 25 years and I decided it's time to start sharing them.</p>

    <p>I don't always make my cards the same way. As a result, these are printable images in various shapes, sizes and formats. The best way to use them is to print them and then manually trace them onto the card stock of your choice.</p>
